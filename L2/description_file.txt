Compiler used was gcc and done using vim text editor on tux.

This folder contains the syncDir.c file, a makefile, and this description_file.txt. 

This program was meant to synchronize two directories. If a file in the first specified directory(a) was not in the second specified directory(b), then a that file would be copied into directory b. If a file was in directory b but not in directory a, then that file would be deleted. If a file is found in both a and b, then that file will be copied into the directory where the file was most recently modified. 

To compile the code, you just have to type "make" into the console. This will compile all the code and it will be ready to run.

To run this code, type "./syncDir ./a ./b" where ./a is the first specified directory and ./b is the second specified directory (you must put "./" in front of directory names for this to work). The program will run and print out the statuses, letting you know what operations were done and where. 

To clean up the directory just type "make clean" into the console.

I found this lab to be very helpful in learning more about File I/O.
