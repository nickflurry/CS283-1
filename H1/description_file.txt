Compiler used was gcc and done using vim text editor on tux.

reverse_file.c (problem 1)
For this file, you must first compile it. I reccommend typing in:
gcc -o reverse reverse_file.c

To start the program enter: ./reverse filename.txt
For filename.txt, you can enter in any text file (make sure to add .txt at the end) as long
as it is in the same directory.
This program is meant to print out the result of a textfile in reverse.
I tested this file by creating a text file of my own, then seeing if the lines were output in
reverse. It worked.

binary_convert.c (problem 2)
Compile using gcc -o convert binary_convert.c
To run use ./convert #
For #, you can enter in any integer

This program is meant to convert any integer into binary. 
I tested this file by entering in a lot of integers and seeing if the conversion
was correct. 

longint_size.c (problem 3)
Compile using gcc -o size longint_size.c
To run use ./size

This program is meant to tell you the size of a long int in bits.
I tested this file by runnign the program, then seeing if it was the correct number.
